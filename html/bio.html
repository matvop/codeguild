        <blockquote><strong>The Theory of Evolution, like the Theory of Gravity,
        is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our
        kinship with all life on earth is not only solid science, in my
        view, it's also a soaring spiritual experience.</strong> <em>--S1E2 Cosmos: A
